This Github repository holds all parts of the research on Technology and its role in improving the quality and efficiency of films in order to keep the information better organized and readily 
accessible to audiences who attend the Undergraduate Research Fair at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute over the summer of 2024. This is intended for these audiences to look at the full 
references and extra details more closely, especially the parts that could not fit within my poster.
